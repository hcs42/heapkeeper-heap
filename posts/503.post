Yes it is, I forgot about this yesterday. The thread page generating
code contains a bunch of copy paste code to walk the thread structure.
I want to write a generic thread structure walking function that can
be used for thread page generation, post page generation etc. When I
do that, I'll try to investigate what is the reason of this behavior.
