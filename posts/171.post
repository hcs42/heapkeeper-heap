What do you say to uploading the index page that indexes the HH posts
and the HH posts themselves to the home page (hste.uw.hu/heapkeeper)?
It would be an example of the heap, which is worth one thousand words.
I could make a documentation page called "Heapkeeper Heap (an example
of the heap)", which would explain what is the Heapkeeper Heap, and it
would contain a screenshot of the index page with explanation drawn on
it. We would also mention why are the heapids so large: because we
have a very active private heap.
