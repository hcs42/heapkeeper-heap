I don't think you see in what way I want to use the [r] tag. I don't
care about when the post was reviewed. I only care about the fact that
it was reviewed once, it does not contain todo-s, and it does not
involve any further work to do. It would make the work of the
maintainers much easier.

We could add a date for the revision, but I don't see any point in
that. If you think there is a use for that, I'm eager to read about
it.
