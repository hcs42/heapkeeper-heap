What do you say to rename "tag" to "label" in Hk?

Advantages:
- others (like Google) use the word "label" for that kind of things
- "label" has a decent Hungarian translation
- we could use the word "tag" for other things, e.g. for some special
  kind of meta text

Of course it is quite a work, so I don't want to do it in the next
few days...
