I propose using the following tags for posts about issues:
- bug: bugs
- feature: new features or improving existing features
- issue: everything else about concrete parts of Hk
- prop: proposals that not about concrete parts of Hk, but about
  coding conventions, procedures, repository usage, workflows, heap
  usage
