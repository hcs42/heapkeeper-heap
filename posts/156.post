== The What ==

Our TODO sums it up pretty well, so I'll copy its points here:

* render URLs as links
* render post metas as links
** this may be obsolete
* handle an inline link syntax
** this'd be similar to MediaWiki's [http://url.com URL] link renaming mechanism
* automatically add tags based on metas
** e.g. if body contains <<<!todo X>>>, add "todo" tag, change meta to
<<<todo X>>>
* handle cites
** this is probably one of the more challenging tasks
** already discussed
<<<!link>>>
* automatic actions on metas
** e.g. if body contains <<<!tagthreadtag unix>>>, add "unix" tag to
whole thread, remove meta
* show authors of quotes
** this requires looking back in the list of parents by the depth of the quote
** will probably ignore errorneous quote depth
* the postâ€™s HTML could contain the whole thread of the post below the
post itself?
** this would break our rule of dependencies; see Architecture
<<<!link>>>
* pre-references to yet non-existing posts
** this is detailed in another post
<<<!link>>>
* hide known metas unless otherwise noted
** probably an option
* show unknown metas specifically
** probably an option

Other ideas:
* the name of authors, and authors' names quoted should be totally ignored
** I long sticked to my habit of keeping others quoted names in posts
** this turned out to be a bad decision, since the names of current
and previous authors are stored on the Heap
<<<!link Hcs already warned me months ago, link it here.>>>
** so, instead of cleaning up manually, let's just make Hk immune to
this dated style
* similarly, Hk could ignore email-ish quote introduction lines (e.g.
Xyz <x@y.z> wrote:)
* perhaps integrate with Wiko? enable
** already discussed
