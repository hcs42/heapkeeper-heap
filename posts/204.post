There is a minor glitch. Not even sure if it's a bug.

If you edit a post, it gets outdated, and will be regenerated. But if
its headers are altered, and the thread representation in post HTMLs
is turned on (in the hkrc), the representation of the changed post
will not be updated in other posts of the thread.
