The branch hcs42/heapkeeper/_v0.3+ contains only one commit which
modified the Hk version number from v0.3 to v0.3+. I think the master
branch should be merged into _v0.3+ and all other commits should be
rebased onto _v0.3+ before merging them into the master. (I don't want
to rebase them now.)

Opinions?
