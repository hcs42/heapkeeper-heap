To tell the truth, I now think that if a text that tries to clarify
something needs this much clarification, it should be scrapped.

Once I have enough time on my hands (maybe the next coach trip?), I'll
have another go at it, and see if it comes out better. The lesson from
this attempt is to avoid unnecessary verbosity.
