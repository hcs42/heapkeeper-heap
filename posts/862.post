I hope I was right. I implemented the old functionality of sections in
a Generator subclass in my hkrc. I really think we should provide more
support for this, as my code is quite complicated.

But there are some problems:
- why is almost all the text red? Is this intended, or error in CSS
coding? (Only on the index is affected, the thread pages are OK, so I
think this might be a bug.)
- using my index, one flat index ("Cip≈ësdoboz") is badly laid out, the
column for tags is too wide, the column for dates is too narrow

I'll look into these issues, as they seem to be closer to my expertise
(HTML/CSS).
