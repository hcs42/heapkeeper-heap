In parallel to implementing the "several heaps" feature [1], I
prepared our heap for the separation. I also wrote a small Python
function that performs the separation and placed it in
hkrc_csabahoch.py. I uploaded the page generated from the separated Hh
here [2] so that you can check it out. You can also check out how the
post bodies are displayed: the meta text and quotes are highlighted,
and the web and heap references are real links.

We should set up a Google Groups account for Hh and send the new
emails there. We should create a GitHub repository for Hh and we
should push the new Hh posts there, so that will be the primary Hh
repository. We should push the HTML pages generated from Hh to
heapkeeper.org.

If you say OK, I will try to do these next weekend. If you don't say
anything, I won't do these next weekend, but probably two weeks later.
