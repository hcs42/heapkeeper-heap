Sure. Parsing an e-mail which has these headers:

    Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=utf-8
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: QUOTED-PRINTABLE

and there is a line in the body that looks like this:

Now, =E4 translates to byte 0xe4, which would start a 3-byte sequence.
The following characters are basic Latin letters (i.e. letters of the
English alphabet). Without looking up their codes, we know this places
them in the range 0x00..0x7f. Therefore, they cannot be continuation
bytes, which are in the range 0x80..0xbf.

How did this happen? The first occurence of this name was as an
author, in a "From:" field, like this:

    From: =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Christian_Bj=E4levik?= <xyz@xyz.se>

He sent this using Thunderbird 0.8 in 8bit transfer-encoding, using
iso-8859-1. No problems so far.

The next message in the thread quotes him like this:

This is still a 0xe4 character, and the message is transfer-encoded in
8bit and character-encoded in iso-8859-1, this time by Mutt 1.5.6. No
problems so far...

The next one in the thread quotes this quote-introduction line as I have
shown above. The message is transfer-encoded in quoted-printable, and
character-encoding is marked as UTF-8, yet the mailing program failed
to convert that 1-byte character into a Unicode character and encode
it properly in UTF-8 (it would have been 0xc3 0xa4).  Unfortunately,
the buggy program has not identified itself -- the relevant header is
not present.

Some other problems:
- messages encoded in "us-ascii" (didn't even know that's legal) but
  containing German national characters in the advertisement appended
  by the mail service provider; Yahoo does this, too, but the
  character here is 0x96 -- n dash. Typographically correct, but
  messes up the encoding.
- a message encoded in utf-8, but in reality double-encoded.

But the majority of problems is simply marking ISO-8859-x encoded
messages as being in UTF-8.
