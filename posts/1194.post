I implemented and pushed this. I kept the ini configuration format,
but I introduced (sub)subsections, so e.g. instead of "[server]" now
we can write "[heaps/hh/server]". Heapkeeper also accepts the old
configuration formats. See the tutorial for examples.

So the "several heaps" feature can be considered as implemented. (Of
course there may be place for minor tweaks.) The tutorial is fully
updated.
